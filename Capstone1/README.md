# Predicting Urban Population
For my first capstone project, I chose to use United Nations/World Bank data to predict the urban population of a country five years in the future. The primary dataset was downloaded from [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/1/united-nations-millennium-development-goals/) after opting to "Join the Competition". I have uploaded it [here](https://github.com/ashtonreed/Springboard/blob/master/Capstone1/data/TrainingSet.csv).

First, I cleaned and merged the data in [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ashtonreed/Springboard/blob/master/Capstone1/notebooks/Capstone1_Data_Wrangling.ipynb).

Next, I analyzed it and plotted it [here](https://github.com/ashtonreed/Springboard/blob/master/Capstone1/notebooks/Capstone1_Storytelling_and_Analysis.ipynb).

Then, I built 2 Linear Regression models and a Lasso model to determine which model was best [here](https://github.com/ashtonreed/Springboard/blob/master/Capstone1/notebooks/Capstone1_Machine_Learning.ipynb). Ultimately, it was the simple linear regression model that had the best R-squared and RMSE scores.

For the final results, please check out the [final report](https://github.com/ashtonreed/Springboard/blob/master/Capstone1/Capstone_Project_1_Final_Report.pdf) or the [presentation deck](https://github.com/ashtonreed/Springboard/blob/master/Capstone1/Predicting_Urban_Population_Presentation.pdf).
