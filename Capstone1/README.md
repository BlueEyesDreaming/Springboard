# Predicting Urban Population
For my first capstone project, I chose to use United Nations/World Bank data to predict the urban population of a country five years in the future. I cleaned and merged the data, analyzed it, plotted it, and built 2 Linear Regression models and a Lasso model to determine which model was best. Ultimately, it was the simple linear regression model with the best R-squared and RMSE scores.

For the final results, please check out the final report (Capstone_Project_1_Final_Report.pdf) or the presentation deck (Predicting_Urban_Population_Presentation.pdf).
